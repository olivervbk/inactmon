1.pray to your god...

2.try running 'sudo ./inactmon.py -d -v debug' to see what gives...

3.check out inactmon.conf

4.run './inactcli.py -v' to get started receiving spam from your computer :D

5.if there are any errors on icons from inactcli.py, run './configure-icon.sh' to set the icons to the system

Note:
-don't really know if setting icons is needed, I guess they work if they are in the current dir...
-generally a good idea to run on ubuntu-10.10 with suported libraries..

If your OS is not supported, and is not Windows or Mac, then report in bug report section and I'll take a look...
