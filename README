This server-client app runs filters(pcap, needs root) and reports results to users by notifications(libnotify).
Currently has 3 filters:
* ICMP Echo Request (Someone pinging you)
* Arp Filter (just demo)
* ScanFilter (tries to detect if someone is scanning the network)

Still very limited and buggy, so beware!
If you like it, buy me a beer. ;)

Dependencies:
python-netifaces
python-pcapy
python-impacket
python-notify
python-appindicator | python-eggtrayicon | just pygtk | none at all, text only

Needs Python2 (pcapy isn't compatible with Python3)

TODO:
* improve notifications speed/recurrence
* check code related to configuration files
* more filters
* improve client
