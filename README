Yada-yada-yada...

This server-client app runs filters(pcap) and reports results to users by notifications(libnotify)...
Still very limited and buggy, so beware!

If you are still thankful, buy me a distilled alcoholic drink... or just donate...

Dependencies:
python-argparse
python-netifaces
python-pcapy
python-impacket
python-notify
python-appindicator | python-eggtrayicon | just pygtk | none at all, text only

Note:
I'm working on some fallback compat.
