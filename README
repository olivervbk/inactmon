This server-client app runs filters(pcap, needs root) and reports results to users by notifications(libnotify).
Currently has 3 filters:
* ICMP Echo Request (Someone pinging you)
* Arp Filter (just demo)
* ScanFilter (tries to detect if someone is scanning the network)
* TcpSynFilter (detects incoming connection attempts)

Still very limited and buggy, so beware!
If you like it, buy me a beer. ;)

DEPENDENCIES:

daemon:
python2-netifaces
python2-pcapy
impacket

client:
python2-notify | libnotify
python-gobject, python2-gobject (depends on python version used...)
OR none at all, use as text only

Needs Python2 for inactmon.py (pcapy isn't compatible with Python3)


GETTING STARTED:
run daemon:
cd src; sudo python2 inactmon.py -d -v debug

run client (will start in tray):
cd src; python2 inactcli.py


TODO:
* improve notifications speed/recurrence
* check code related to configuration files
* more filters
* improve client
